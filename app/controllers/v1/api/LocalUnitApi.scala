   * Note that it is unusual for a RESTful service to return 404 for a "collection" resource; the typical response
   * ia a 200 with "empty collection" representation.
   * A 404 is justified here by the expectation in our data model that any existing enterprise / period combination
   * should have at least one local unit.  The 404 therefore indicates that there is no such collection resource for
   * an unknown enterprise / period - which is semantically different from a resource existing that is empty.
